# Marcasite

Marcasite is a gem built for small companies who want their marketing site to be a part of their main app. Often they have only one person doing development/technical work, and if they are writing a web app, it's in Rails.

Marcasite will have features similar to Wordpress, but built in Rails so that it can be easily extended.
